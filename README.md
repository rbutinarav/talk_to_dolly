This project is a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to ask questions and receive answers generated by pre-trained Transformer models from Hugging Face. Users can choose between different models to get answers in various contexts such as translation or general knowledge. It also allows users to test the Dolly GPT model by Databricks.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

- streamlit
- accelerate
- transformers

These dependencies can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file included in the package:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
